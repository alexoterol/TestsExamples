## Repository: Unit Testing in Java with JUnit
# Overview
This repository was created to demonstrate and explore the importance of unit testing in software development. Through a collection of test cases using JUnit, the repository illustrates how different methods, including edge cases, can be tested effectively in Java. The focus is on ensuring that code behaves as expected in various scenarios and catches potential bugs early in the development process. <br/>

The repository includes: <br/>

Test cases for a Calculation class that finds the maximum value in an array. <br/>
Test cases for an Employee class that calculates monthly salary and year-end bonuses based on various conditions. <br/>
Each test case covers a range of inputs, including valid data, invalid data, and edge cases, ensuring robustness in the logic and behavior of the methods. <br/>

## Why I Created This Repository
I created this repository as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of unit testing and how it fits into the broader scope of software quality assurance. Writing tests improves the reliability of the codebase and ensures that features work as intended, even after changes or updates to the code.

In this repository, I focused on the following: <br/>

Test coverage: Writing tests for various scenarios and conditions, including edge cases and invalid inputs. <br/>
Code validation: Ensuring that the code behaves as expected for a variety of inputs. <br/>
Learning JUnit: Strengthening my skills with the JUnit testing framework, which is widely used for unit testing in Java. <br/>
## Why Unit Testing is Important 
Unit testing is essential because it: <br/>

Catches bugs early: Unit tests help developers identify issues early in the development process, reducing the time and effort needed to fix problems later.<br/>
Provides documentation: Well-written tests can serve as documentation for how different parts of the code should behave under various conditions. <br/>
Improves code quality: Writing tests forces developers to think about edge cases and potential failures, leading to better-designed and more robust code. <br/>
Supports refactoring: When refactoring or updating code, having a comprehensive suite of tests ensures that changes donâ€™t break existing functionality. <br/>
Boosts confidence in changes: With a solid set of tests, developers can confidently make changes, knowing that their tests will catch any unintended consequences. <br/>
# How to Use This Repository
